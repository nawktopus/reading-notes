HTML and JavaScript are the building blocks of the websites and the internet. They are important to understand as it is how we interpret information and able to display it across computers around the world. It is crucial to understand these types of concepts to well round our understanding of programming and website creation.

Getting Started
1. Poem (Haiku)
To use the web, it
requires TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP 
to communicate
2. Parsing happens in an order of HTML, then CSS and then JS files. When parsing HTML, it checks for <link> that leads to CSS stylesheets and <script> referencing to any javascript files.
3. You can check on google images or bing images, any sort of search engine for images. Just double check for copyright status and usage.
4. let var = "Jordan"; and let var = 25;
5. A variable is a placeholder for data. You can store text in the form of string, numbers both whole and numbers with decimal points and even the value of true or false for boolean. It is a container to store values.  
  
Introduction to HTML
1. An HTML attribute are modifiers placed within the tag of an element. 
2. An HTML element has an opening and closing tag and in the middle is the content and attribute, if applicable.
3. The difference between `<article>` and `<section>` is that an `<article>` is best used as a standalone tag to display self-contained content while a `<section>` is bested used to separate and highlight specific information like chapters or sections.  
4. A typical website usually has `<html>, <head>, <title>, <body>, <h1>, <p>, <a>, <img>, and <div>` elements. 
5. Metadata is important for search engine optimization, such as the use of the <meta name="Description" content="This is my homepage."> to show directly on the search engine result a short description of what this page is used for without having to click on it directly. It helps when searching for specific websites. 
6. For example of use as a descriptor: `<meta name="Author" content="Jordan Kwan">` , it data used to describe data. This is able to show who is the author of the text.

Miscellaneous
1. Project Ideation is the first step. What do you want to accomplish from the website, how will the website reach your goals and what needs to be done and in what order to help reach your goals. You need to know why you want to create the website before you create one.
2. What exactly do I want to accomplish? This is the most important question that needs to be answered when thinking about designing a website.

Semantics
1. Using `<h1>` over `<span>` is because there is no semantic value using span.
2. Some benefits of using semantic tags are that it will optimize search engine use for better rankings, help visually impaired users navigate a page, as well as give the code a clean look when reading through it.

JavaScript  
1. Browser and Third party API's. DOM (Document Object Model) API and HTMLMediaElement are examples that give dynamism to your homepage and require JavaScript.
2. You must use <script>'s and place them in the `<head>` or `<body>` elements.

## Things I want to know more about
  The meaning of a semantic value and why that gives `<h1>` more purpose than `<span>`. A better understanding of semantics and its importance. Better understanding of things that JavaScript requires in the browser.
