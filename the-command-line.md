# Practice in the Terminal

## Summary
  The command line is definitely different from GUI's that we're used to. It is all line based and everywhere you need to go is through cd or ls commands. You can create directories, which are like folders with mkdir. You also need to make sure you're in the right place in the hierarchy of folders or else you won't be able to get or do what you need to. Using pwd will remind you of where you are and if you need to go up or down a level of nested folders. Everything is case sensitive so it imperative to be cautious of which files you mess around with. Since everything is line based it can be easier to navigate once you understand what you're looking for and what to do. I think its neat how fast you can open things and just save things but with that is also scary if you delete or update something without being cautious of what it is.
