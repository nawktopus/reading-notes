# Reading Images, Color, and Text

**HTML Media**

1. What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?
  A real world use case would be if the internet speed is slow and it can display what the image should be, 
  visually impaired, can be easier for search engine optimization.    
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
  You can use an use `alt` or `<a>` and have descriptors for those who are visually impaired or for those who can't use a lot of bandwidth.     
3. Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.
   It would be useful when describing an image. You're able to add a caption and provide a caption for what the image is.
4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
   The difference between a `gif` and an `svg` is the clarity. It's like watching tv on an older tv unit in comparision to a flat screen. The flat screen is the `svg`
   and is clear no matter how far you look at it or close. The `gif` is the older tv units that look clearer from a far but can be fuzzy if you look closely.
5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
  I would use a `PNG` to display screenshots on my website because it has a better browser support for reproducing the images on mobile or even desktop websites.

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
  The foreground is the item in front while the background is the item in the back. Think of a solar eclipe. The moon is in front of the sun and you mostly see the moon in the
  foreground and the sun in the background, behind it.
2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
  I would try to coordinate a good set of colours and use those to touch it up. I would use `background-color` , `color` , and `border-color` to try to make some things
  pop out more for the blog.
3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
  You should consider `web safe fonts` as some fonts won't be available across the interet. For better visibility, you should use a web safe font.      
4. What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?
  You can adjust the size of the text on the page with `font-size`. With `font-weight`, you can adjust the thickness and make it **bold**. And `font-style` allows
  you to make it *italicized*. 
5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.
  You can use `letter-spacing` or `word-spacing`. `letter-spacing` lets you adjust the space between each character. `word-spacing` allows you to adjust the spacing 
  between each word.
