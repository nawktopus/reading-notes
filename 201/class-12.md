# Understanding Chart.js and Canvas

## JavaScript Canvas
 
 1. What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?
    It allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript. 
 2. What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?
    The importance of a closing tag for `<canvas>` is because it is fallback content. Similar to an `<alt` for `<img>` tags. It'll display this message if the canvas isn't supported on the browser.
 3. Explain what the `getContext()` method does.
  The `getContext()` returns a render context object. If you give the method the argument of `"2d"`, it will render a 2D rendering context object. 
  
## Chart.js

1. What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?
    Chart.js is a way to chart in JavaScript, you just need a `<canvas>` tag and setting that to a css styling class. 
2. List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.
  You can create area charts, bar charts, bubble charts, doughnut charts, and pie charts. 

## Animated Charts with Chart.js
