# Understanding Local Storage

## Local Storage and How to Use It

1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
  It is useful for reducing latency for caching data. It can take a long time to cache the data rather than storing the data locally on the user's storage via a cookie. 
2. What information should not be stored in local storage?
  Any sensitive information as its not as secure as cookies. 
3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
  Local storage can only store strings in different keys. You can store the information in an object and convert it when reading it to work around it .

## Things I want to know more about
When would we use local storage or cookies when making our own sites and if we need to inform the users who access it.
