## Recursion

Recursion is a loop. It calls itself within a function. If used properly can be used to your advantage. If it doesn't stop the loop then it can cause the computer to crash because of overstackflow or computer runs out of memory. There is a base case that stop calling itself when a condition has been met. The fibonacci sequence is a good example of using recurision.
