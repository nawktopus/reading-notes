# Classes and Objects

Classes are like templates that hold a structure for objects. It has changeable aspects that can be manipulated for any purpose and copied. It can hold different sets of variables and functions that you can change to fit your needs. Recursion if the act of creating a function and calling upon the function within the function until it reaches a certain condition using a base case and recursive case. The base case is a certain outcome that it will fall back on once the recursive case as done what it needs to do. For example 1! is 1 and that can be the base case. Trying to find the factorial of 3, you would multiple 3 by the (n-1, in this case 3-1). You can do 3 x 2 x 1! or 3 x 2! whichever would be faster. Pytesting is powerful in the way you create your code. It is exactly what you want out of your code without writing the code, its almost working backwards to work forwards approach.
