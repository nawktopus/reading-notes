# Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Discussion Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
    Efficiency and what you need to use the data for. 

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

    Using a base case along with the recursive case to ensure it doesn't loop.
