# Ten Thousand Game 1

    Random Module is help for the ten thousand game as there are different types of random numbers for the different dice. Random module consists of randint(), random(), choice(), shuffle(), and randrange(). We need to pick between the range of 1 and 6, including 1 and 6. Test coverage is important especially for this game since it has many outcomes. You need to test for the different outcomes and hoping that it'll test for the specific outcome. Test-driven development is important for this because of planning. We need to think about all the possible outcomes intended for the dices being rolled each round. Part of solving and coding with prep ahead will be invaluable for later.
