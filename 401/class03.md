# FileIO & Exceptions

Files are made up of 3 parts: Header, Data and End of File (EOF). To open a file `file = open('example.txt')`. You always want to make sure to close out the file no matter what. Try and finally block of code helps ensure you always close the txt files. These attributes are part of commands 'r', 'w', and 'rb', 'wb' for reading, writing and overwriting files. `with` is usually the best way to handle closing files as it does so automatically.
