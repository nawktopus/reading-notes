# The Growth

## Summary of Videos

The main gist of the videos to push yourself out of your comfort zone and try new things. You want to be able to think about your potential and what you think about your potential. The mind is a powerful thing and if we don't have a good mindset we can be stuck and not able to progress. We should have Grit, and able to believe that we can improve ourselves. 


## Emotional Intelligence 

Everything seems pretty on par with what I expected. I feel that I'm pretty well aware of my surroundings and reading the room. I can pick up on social cues and intense emotions and try to work around that. I do know that I need to work on some relationship and self management within myself. I can be a little blunt or too direct sometimes or not direct enough and should try to make sure people understand where I'm coming from so that there is no misunderstandings. 

## Biases 

I noticed that I was strong in all areas except Effective Courage and Empathy and Curiosity. I should probably work on those two in the coming weeks but also still try to figure out ways to improve on the other areas that I already seem to be doing well with. There's always room to improve with bias as this affects everyone around us. There is no way to just avoid this because we should try to be as inclusive as much as possible. The more we come together, the better we're able to work together and solve any problems that we may need to.
