# Engineering Readings

## Discussion Questions 

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

    One thing that I know I can bring to the table is that I will search for the answer. I will dig through so many sources to figure why something does or doesn't work. I love to research in my free time for arbitrary things which extends to things I know I need to understand.
    
2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

    I'm going to try to follow the solving problems method of coding. Ensuring that I know what the problem is asking, trying to solve the problem with provided data and write the code in pseudocode. If I can break things down into terms that I understand, it may be easier to code when I can get the solution without coding.
