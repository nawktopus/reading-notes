    LEGB Rule 

    - Local 
    
    - Enclosing 

    - Global

    - Built-In 

    Global scope is available to all of the code, very tempermental if misassigned.

    Local Scope is defined within scope and only available within scope.

Python uses scope to avoid keeping in mind the name of a variable because you implement it in local scopes and can name them accordingly within it.

`name = 'Jordan'`

`def print_name():`

`name = 'Joe'`

`print(name)`

print_name function would print out Joe because that is local but if it were removed or commented out, it would print out Jordan because that is the global variable.

Remember to use LEGB as much as possible.
