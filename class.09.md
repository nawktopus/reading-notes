# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?

Functional Programming is a style of building the structure and elements of the program and treating it as an evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

A pure function is when it returns the same result if given the same arguments and does not cause any observable side effects.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

Pure function benefits are easy testing and can have referntial transparency.

4. What is immutability?
    
Immutability is the inability to be changed or mutated.
    
5. What is Referential transparency?

When a pure function and immutable data come together. Same result from the same input.
  
## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

1. What is a module?

A module is different bit of code and functionality and call on them when needed. Separating code. Another JavaScript file.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?

`Require` is the path to the module. 

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

`require('xyz');`

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
  
`Module.exports =xyz`
