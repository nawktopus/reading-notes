## Pain and Suffering
  Pain is different from suffering because you're enduring and growing while you learn. Suffering is just not knowing what to do to get better. You can be in pain but you will grow from that. It's like when you exercise a muscle and how it hurts initially but you'll eventually learn to be better when doing more exercises using that muscle. No pain, no gain. But suffering is when you're helpless and not knowing where to start or continue from.
  
## Beginners Guide to Big O
  Big O refers to time and space required to execute a program or function. There are many ways to execute them with O(1), O(N), O(N^2), and O(2^N). They all perform differently. O(1) is always going to execute and perform at the same measure. O(N) performs linerally and in proportion to the size of the data. O(N^2) will perforam dirrectly proportionate to the square of the size of the data. O(2^N) performs exponentially as its data grows. There are just different ways to view the performance of data.
