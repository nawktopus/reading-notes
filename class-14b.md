# Understanding `What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team`

## Take Away

The main takeaway from this article is that you should feel comfortable in a team. Not everyone should or has to be like minded to be able to achieve good results but it can help. Open communication and equal collaboration is key to creating a successful team. Allowing everyone to speak their mind and hopefully stir the pot, especially if there is no main direction for the group. Speak your mind and let everyone feel heard is very important. You shouldn't feel discouraged for speaking about an idea because it may or may not be used but it might help in the grand scheme of things. Mentioning the idea may have someone else think about something related and that could spark the direction of where the group goes.
