## NoSQL vs SQL
  
1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
    |SQL | NoSQL |
    |----|-------|
    |Has Relational Databases (RDBMS)    | non-relational or distrubuted databases       |
    |Predefined schema    | dynamic schema for unstructured data       |
    |Vertically scaleable by increaming the horse-power of the hardware    |Horizontally scaleable by increasing the databases servers in pool of resources to reduce load       |
    |SQL uses structured query language for definding and manipulating data    |NoSQL uses unstructured query language, focused on collection of documents       |
    |SQL can increase load by increasing cpu,ram,ssd on a single server    |NSQL can increase load handling by adding more servers to handle traffic       |

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

    Tabled based data.

3. Give a real world example.

    Netflix and instagram. Good use to grab numbers of views, watches, etc and manipulate and project possible earnings and projections.

4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

    Document based, key-value pairs and graphs.

5. Give a real world example.

    Product cataloging. It ensures documents contain relevant information thanks to its Dynamic Schema Capability.

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

    NoSQL

7.Which type of database is best for scalability?

    SQL

## sql vs nosql

1. What does SQL stand for?

    Structured Query Language.

2. What is a relational database?

    A database that hows different databases that are related and used interchangably.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

    One to One, One to Many and Many to Many.

4. What is a ‘schema’?

    Defines how data is organized within a relational database.

5. What is a NoSQL database?

    Stores lots of data in an efficient way compared to SQL databases.

6. How does it work?

    Databases connects to collections and documents within collections.

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?

    Database, collections and documents.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

    MongoDB because it is more flexible with no schema to follow.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

    Has data in different spots and is not relational.
