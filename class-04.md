# Understanding HTML Links, JavaScript FUnctions and Intro to CSS.

**Learn HTML** 

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
  To create a link, you have to wrape text within an `<a>` element and an `href` attribute.
  
2. The `href` attribute contains what information?
  The `href` attribute contains the web address for example, `<a href="https://www.google.com/"> The Google Homepage</a>`.
  
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
  Good practice for links to be accessible for readers is to have keywords as the link name. It is also good to keep it as short as possible. 
  
**CSS Layout**

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
  The flow in which the webpage elements would be laid out if the person who is programming the site hadn't changed anything.
  
2. What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline elements` ?
  Block-level elements fill the entire inline space of the parent element and can grow along the block's dimension, while inline elements are just the size of the
  content that they hold. Inline elements don't appear on new lines.
  
3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
  Static
  
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
  Absolute positioning doesn't exist in normal document flow. Positioning is also different because it has `top` , `bottom` , `left` , and  `right` which allows it
  to be more customized.
  
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
  Fixed positioning fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. You can create useful items.

**Learn JS**

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
    Function declaration is declaring the function and variables within it. Invocation is executing the function. 
    
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  A parameter is a value declared when function is declared. An argument is defined within a function when it is executed. 
  
**Miscellaneous**

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
    Two benefits is greater efficiency and better social skills. You are able to work better with two set of eyes on the same code than each person frustrated
  looking over the code separately. Also it is useful to gain more social skills by being comfortable with your code being looked over. You are able to work well
  with others.
