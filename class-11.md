# Understanding Audio, Video, Images

## Video and Audio Content

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
  The ability to use video and audio since the 00's has changed in the fact that HTML handles it rather than through obsolete and older methods of flash and silverlight which proved to have accessibility and security issues. 
  
2. Describe the use of the `src` and `controls` attributes in the `<video>` element.
  `src` is the same usage as images and just pulls the video from the link or location. `controls` allows users to control the video by pausing/playing it and controlling the volume, which is included in the browsers own control interface.
  
3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?
  It is important to have a fallback content inside the video element for compatiability and accessibility assurance. If you provide multiple types of video types, it'll allow one or the other to play depending on the browser being used. 
  
4. Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters.
  Audio and video are friends who are talented at two different things. Audio is a great public speaker and allows their voice to be heard by anyone and everyone who is willing to listen to them. Video can have a shy side but is also vocal at times but is more of a visual type of person. They both do two different things but are very important people. 
  
## Guide to Grid

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
  Grid differs from flex is that it's 2 dimensional grid based layout than flex which is 1 dimensional. You're able to adjust along the x and y axis. 

2. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.
  Grid container is the direct parent for all the grid items. Contains them all. Grid items are the children of the grid container, but not sub items. Grid line is the line that set up the grid. They're all important to set up the foundation of the grid. 
  
## Responsive Images

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
    Responsive images spanning different screen sizes help with the image sizes adjusting with each kind of device and orientation. If its not responsive the images on the website might look to small or too stretched. 
    
2. Define the following `<img>` attributes `srcset` and `sizes`. Write an example of how they are used.
  `srcset` defines the set of images we allow the browser to choose and what size each image is. `sizes` defines a set of media conditions like what the image size would best to choose, max width.
3. How is `srcset` more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
  `srcset` is more helpful than CSS and JavaScript because it uses the real size with instrinsic width. It also is more accessible than some JavaScript and CSS for different web browser compatiability.
