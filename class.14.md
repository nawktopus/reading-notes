# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding
  
1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

   Personal home computers were starting to become a household object. This allowed males to start to understand and use them outside of classes or any technical school.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

    There was a strict prejudice and advantage that males were more likely to be gifted a computer and able to advance with them faster or better than a female would.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company
  
1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

    They are successful when they're driven by a commitment from company leaders and leader understanding why diversity is needed.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

    They perform better because of all sorts of different point of views and backgrounds. Everyone has different ideas and ways of doing things that might work out better than one way thinking.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

    The example provided with Youtube not keeping in mind that their user base has different methods of using it and catering to only right-hand users caused an error in operation for left-hand users. They should keep in mind that there are need for more accessible features and other needs for their diverse user base.
