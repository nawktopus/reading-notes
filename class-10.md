# Debugging 

## Troubleshooting JavaScript 

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
  A Syntax Error is an error in the syntax or the code write up. A missing spelled variable or function can cause the application to act weird. A Logic Error is an error in how the code runs. It doesn't perform specific actions because it missing something or has code running when it shouldn't. The logic is off. 
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
  I've run into many syntax errors where I mispelled the name of the variable or function as well as missing a `,` or `;` or `}`. I was about to use the console.log to display the error that doesn't show up in visual code. I have had a few logic errors as well where I wasn't able to get the results I wanted from a loop or alert. I used a lot of trial and error and/or the console/inspector element in my browser to figure out what was going on. 
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
  This topic will surely be a part of my career with coding. I am not perfect so I won't be coding everything perfectly and that's okay. It'll just teach me more about my code and what things I need to work on when coding. 
  
## JavaScript Debugger 

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
  It is a full fledge tool that is useful for finding any errors in your code. You're able to run specific lines of code to isolate the issue if possible. 
2. Define what a breakpoint is.
  A breakpoint is a portion intentionally made to pause execution to debug parts of code. 
3. What is the call stack?
  A call stack displays what code that was executed. It's helpful to have this with a breakpoint to see what code just ran and help you debug the error.
