# More CRUD

## CRUD BASICS
  
1. Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?
    
 We would use a PUT request.
    
2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

Both PUT and DELETE require and ID parameter.

## Building a CRUD API
  
1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
    
CRUD can exist within a REST API but a REST API isn't limited to just CRUD functions.
    
2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

Create react app. Install necessary components. Write the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE within an app or router. Test them with a client. Connect to front end.
