Understanding the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript.

Intro to HTML

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
  Using semantic elements in HTML is important because it allows it to display cleaner code. It sorts things in a pleasing and easy to read manner. It also helps with search engine optimization.  

2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?
  There are 6 levels of head `<h1>` to `<h6>`.
  
3. What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?
  You can use `<sup>` for things like dates or exponents in math, 25<sup>th</sup>. `<sub>` can be useful for chemistry when you need to display the full chemical formula, H<sub>2</sub>O. 
  
4. When using the `<abbr>` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?
  When using the `<abbr>`, you must use the `title` attribute to provide the full expansion.

Learn CSS

1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
  You can apply CSS to HTML using three methods: External stylesheet, Internal stylesheet, or Inline styling.
  
2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?
  It is the least efficient way to implement style, it can mix with HTML code and can be difficult to read.
  
3. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:
  
  - What is representing the selector?
    The selector is h2.
  
  - Which components are the CSS declarations?
    The declaration components is `color: black;` `padding: 5px;`.

  - Which components are considered properties?
    The two properties are `color` and `padding`. 
  
Learn JS

1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?
   A string is a data type that is enclosed in single quotation marks `''`.

2. List 4 types of JavaScript operators.
  Four types of JavaScript operators are Addition (+) to add two number or strings together, Assignment (=) to assign value to the variable, Strict equality (===) to check if two values are equal, and Division (/) to divide two numbers.
  
3. Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.
  You can use a function to solve simple things like adding the total amount of lemons you have in your backyard. You can like pull two variables and add them together when inputted and return the total value.
  
Conditionals 

1. An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.
   condition; true
   
2. What is the use of an else if?
  The purpose of an else if is to allow more options and conditions by chaining more to the if else loop.
  
3. List 3 different types of comparison operators.
  ===, <, and >= are different comparision operators.
  
4. What is the difference between the logical operator `&&` and `||`?
  The difference between `&&` and `||` is that `&&` requires all statements to be true, for example, it is cold AND wet outside. While `||` is true if one or the other is true.
  
 ## Things I want to know more about
 I would love to get a better understanding of git commits. Also the difference between some of the operators as some seem similar to each other.
